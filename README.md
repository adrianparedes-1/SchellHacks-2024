**Inspiration**
The idea for Chemist Slayer came from my own experience with Chemistry. My professor required us to memorize the periodic table and common acids, which I found challenging. I wished there was a more engaging way to learn them, and that's how Chemist Slayer was bornâ€”to make learning Chemistry fun through interactive gameplay.

**What it does**
Chemist Slayer is an educational game where players navigate through rooms while being chased by enemies. With limited time and health, they must collect the correct elements to create a chemical formula for a random acid. Success means escaping the enemies, but a mistake can lead to failure if the wrong elements are gathered.

**How we built it**
We developed Chemist Slayer using Unity, combining various elements like player movement, item interaction, and dynamic UI.

**Challenges we faced**

Learning and implementing Git for version control.
Developing dynamic user interfaces.
Implementing player attack mechanics and enemy AI.
Accomplishments we're proud of

Successfully creating enemy AI that tracks and chases the player within range.
Building dynamic UI that updates as the player collects items.
What we learned
We gained a deep understanding of Unity, particularly in UI development, player movement, and item interactions. Managing the game's interactive elements taught us valuable lessons for future projects.

**What's next for Chemist Slayer**
The next step for Chemist Slayer includes adding combat mechanics, allowing players to fight back against enemies using melee or ranged attacks. We also plan to expand the list of chemicals players can learn, introduce new maps, and create different enemy types to enhance the game's educational aspect.
